"""
The identities a user can sign in with, and the policy that depends on them.

A user reaches the site through one of several routes: an ORCID account, a
Google account, or a local account with an email address and a password. Any
number of these can be connected to the same user, and they can be connected in
any order -- somebody who registered with an email address today can add their
ORCID iD tomorrow.

One thing does depend on *which* identity is connected. Publishing a dataset
mints a citable, immutable record, and the person who mints it has to be
identifiable as a researcher, so a publication requires a connected ORCID
account. That rule lives here rather than in the publication code because it is
a statement about identity, and because the check has to be available to the UI
(to explain the requirement before somebody fills in a publication form) as
well as to the view layer (to enforce it).
